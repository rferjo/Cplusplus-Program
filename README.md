# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The program that was written is for Corner Grocer that allows for a grocery tracking program. The program analyzes text records of the items that were purchased to determine how often the items are being purchased. The program has four different menu options : the first menu option can search for a specific item and how many, the second menu prints a list of all the items and how many, the third list prints a histogram of the how often itâ€™s purchased information and the last menu is to exit the program. This program does use Maps for implementation and requires the creation of a data file for the backing up of the accumulated data. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I particularly did well with time management and really taking my time on each section. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would add more comment lines as to whats happening within the code for futher clarification. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Knowing where to put the private and public codes is where I had a challenge but after going back to zybooks and looking further I was able to figure it out.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Really making use of the readinput & printItem will be transferable to other projects


# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Personally, I took this porgram section by section and only worked on a section a day so that I didn't overwhelm myself and so that I wasn't coding incorrectly.
